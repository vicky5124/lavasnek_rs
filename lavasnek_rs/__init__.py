-------------------
lavalink-rs bindings for Python

Cheat Sheet:

- Functions that return a `Result<T, E>` mean that it can raise an exception. `T` is the type they
return normally, and `E` is a list of possible exceptions that can raise.
- Functions that return an `Option<T>` mean that the value returned can be `None`, where `T` would be
the type of the returned value if not `None`.
- If something returns a `Future<T>`, it means that it returns
[this](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-future.html?#asyncio.Future),
and that function should be awaited to work.
- / on arguments means the end of positional arguments.
- Self (with a capital S) means the type of self.
- A type prefixed with `impl` means it's a Class that implements that Trait type.
